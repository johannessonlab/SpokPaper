# Spok paper code
Scripts and snakemake pipelines associated with the paper of Vogan &amp; Ament-Velasquez et al. "Combinations of *Spok* genes create multiple meiotic drivers in *Podospora*" (submitted)

All these analyses rely on the JGI version of the reference S genome [Espagne et al. (2008)](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2008-9-5-r77) called Podan2. I added a chimeric mitochondrial genome (Genebank NC_001329.3) to attract mitochondrial and plasmid reads. I provide a copy of the final fasta file within each folder of the Snakemake pipelines.
